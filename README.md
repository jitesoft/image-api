# Image API

## Idea

The idea is to have a simple REST API to upload images too, the images are placed in a s3 compatible storage and queued 
to be formatted depending on values passed into the API.  

## Why?

The project is mainly a playground to try out different tech in C#, while if the application
becomes something useful, it might be turned into some type of SaaS.
